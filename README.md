# Anti-Food

Exploring new products at the grocery store was always a joy, but the excitement often turned to frustration when faced with confusing ingredient lists and marketing jargon. One afternoon, overwhelmed by the complexity of a cereal box's ingredients, I snapped a photo and sent it to my tech-savvy friend with a simple plea: "I wish there was an app that could tell me what all these things are and if they're good for me."
Soon after the challenge took another height by being in a remote area with a foreign language, so I wanted to resolve not only the translation issue but consider the marketing jargon that must be simplified into keywords that are easy to get in the native language.
 And soon with modern technologies and new capabilities in Generative AI, I created an application for it, called “Anti-Food”.

The application consists mainly of 2 screens, 1 to take a photo and the other screen to see the results interpreted with AI capabilities. It extracts keywords from vague descriptions, translates marketing jargon, and puts a potential health risk grade via colors.
